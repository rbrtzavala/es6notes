  // var variabledeclaratin is hoisted to top of scope
  console.log({pizza0});

  // Temporal Dead Zone
  // let and const cannot be accessed before defined
  console.log({pizza1});
  console.log({pizza2});

  var pizza0 = 'Deep dish 🍕';
  let pizza1 = 'Deep dish 🍕🍕';
  const pizza2 = 'Deep dish 🍕🍕🍕';

  console.log({pizza0, pizza1, pizza2});

  // Rule of thumb
  // 1. use const by default
  // 2. only use let if rebinding is needed
  // 3. var shouldn't be used in es6

  // Kyle Simposon's take
  // 1. Use var for top-level variables shared across many scopes.
  // 2. Use let for localized variables in smaller scopes.
  // 3. Refactor let to const only after some code has been written and reasonably sure you have a case where there isn't reassignment.
